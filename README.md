# Dependency Injection Demystified with Go and Wire

This repository contains a simple example illustrating the concept of dependency injection using Go programming language and Google's Wire tool.

## Introduction

Dependency Injection is a software design pattern used to facilitate loose coupling between components by allowing external entities, often referred to as 'injectors' or 'containers,' to provide the required dependencies or services to an object. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability within a system.

This project demonstrates how dependency injection simplifies code complexity and enhances maintainability using a goat-themed scenario. It includes sample code snippets and explanations to showcase how Go and Wire can be utilized for dependency injection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this example, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go
- Google's Wire tool (installed via `go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest`)

Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

- main.go: Contains the main program showcasing dependency injection.
- repository.go: Defines the repository interface and its implementation for goat actions.
- service.go: Illustrates a service that retrieves goat actions from the repository.
- server.go: Implements an HTTP server that returns goat actions.

Usage

Explore the code examples provided in each file to understand the implementation of dependency injection in Go using the goat scenario.
Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the examples, add more goat actions, or enhance the explanations. Happy coding! üêêüöÄ
