# What's the Goat Doing?

What's the Goat Doing? is a simple game that generates a random action performed by a goat.

This repository features articles that are part of the "Demystifying with Go" series articles written on Medium, explaining software related concepts using Go. Each article is tagged with the number of the article in the series and the topic it covers.

## Articles
### 1. [Dependency Injection Demystified: Simplifying Code Complexity with Go and Wire](https://medium.com/thegoathub/dependency-injection-demystified-simplifying-code-complexity-with-go-and-wire-40d1571dc5fe) (Tag: `v1.dependency-injection`)
Dependency Injection is a software design pattern used to facilitate loose coupling between components by allowing external entities, often referred to as 'injectors' or 'containers,' to provide the required dependencies or services to an object. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability within a system.

This project demonstrates how dependency injection simplifies code complexity and enhances maintainability using a goat-themed scenario. It includes sample code snippets and explanations to showcase how Go and Wire can be utilized for dependency injection.

To run this example, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go
- Google's Wire tool (installed via `go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest`)

### 2. [gRPC Demystified: Building Efficient Communication in Go](https://medium.com/thegoathub/grpc-demystified-building-efficient-communication-in-go-86ccb3c2660f) (Tag: `v2.grpc`)
gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that allows you to build distributed applications and services efficiently. It is based on HTTP/2 and uses Protocol Buffers as its interface definition language.

This project demonstrates how gRPC can be used to build a simple server and client in Go. It includes sample code snippets and explanations to showcase how gRPC can be utilized for efficient communication.

To run this example, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go
- Protocol Buffers (installed via `go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest`)
